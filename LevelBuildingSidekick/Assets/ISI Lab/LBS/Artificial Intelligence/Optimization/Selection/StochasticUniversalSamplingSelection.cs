    /// Stochastic Universal Sampling is an elaborately-named variation of roulette wheel selection. 
    /// Stochastic Universal Sampling ensures that the observed selection frequencies of each individual 
    /// are in line with the expected frequencies. So if we have an individual that occupies 4.5% of the 
    /// wheel and we select 100 individuals, we would expect on average for that individual to be selected 
    /// between four and five times. Stochastic Universal Sampling guarantees this. The individual will be 
    /// selected either four times or five times, not three times, not zero times and not 100 times. 
    /// Standard roulette wheel selection does not make this guarantee.
